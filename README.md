// CONGRATULATIONS DAVI!!!
// Welcome to the nerd club (again).
// When Moni suggested getting you a present for your gradution (well done btw :D) I thought I'd make one instead and open up another super awesome world of nerdiness/coolness (to us... not them :P)!
//
// The code below controls an ESP8266 (an Arduino compatible microcontroller) thats written in C++ (kinda... they made thier own language to make things easier but its very C++ like).
// 1# - it should start by initialising as an access point for you to give it your wifi credentials (it should be called #define NAME below).
// 2# - you need to use the Alexa app to connect the device to your network (it should be called #define ID_RELAY below)
// 3# - say "Alexa, pesce rosso on/off" and hope it doesn't blow up XD
//
// Well done for graduating good sir!! I know from experience how hard it is to get there and I don't doubt there is a lot of awesome projects to come!
//
// Disclaimer: this shouldn't burn down your lovely new house XD

How it works
